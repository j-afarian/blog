<span class="image left"><img src="/images/wedding/japan-s01.png" alt="Jenna eating a japanese sweet roll" /></span>In mid 2017 my soon-to-be husband and I visited 8 cities & towns across Japan and The United States during our *wedding vacation*. We were both in agreement that spending an exorbitant amount of money on a single day wasn't the direction we wanted to go in, and coupled with my ever-growing anxiety, we decided to keep it small and exciting.

Starting in early June we flew in to Japan and began 10 days of temples, shrines, gardens, and sprawling cities filled with life at all hours. We spent our days visiting cultural sites, eating delicious street food, experiencing the wild deer, and getting lost in the expansive shopping district of Shibuya. At night we hopped through the tiny bars found in Golden Gai, each one seating anywhere from 4-8 people, went clubbing, and did an amazing bar crawl.

There were so many amazing places, but the ones listed below were some of my favorites.

<h3>9 must-see places in Japan</h3>
- Golden Gai (Tokyo)
- Shibuya Crossing (Tokyo)
- Sensō-ji (Tokyo)
- Meji Shrine (Tokyo)
- Nara Deer Park (Kyoto)
- Fushimi Inari-taisha (Kyoto)
- Nijō Castle (Kyoto)
- Peace Memorial (Hiroshima)
- Atomic Bomb Dome (Hiroshima)

From Japan we flew to The United States. Landing in LAX is always an adventure of it's own, but we eventually made it through and checked in to our hotel down in Santa Monica. It was here that most of our family met up with us in anticipation for the wedding day, and we spent a few days exploring and visiting family who live in Los Angeles before heading off to Las Vegas.

<span class="image right"><img src="/images/wedding/vegas-s02.png" alt="You may now kiss the bride - wedding photo" /></span>Yep, we got married in Las Vegas. On Monday the 26th of June at 10am, we headed off to the Chapel of the Flowers on Las Vegas Boulevard. Surrounded by family and friends we got fake married. Uh-huh, that's right. We were enjoying ourselves so much in Vegas that we both forgot to go pick up our marriage license the day before!! We had a pretend ceremony in front of everyone before frantically dashing downtown to pick up our license and sign the papers with the chapel afterwards. Oops!

Aside from that *little* hiccup, it was a fantastic day. We enjoyed a gorgeous Italian lunch at [Maggiano's](https://www.maggianos.com/) before heading back to a Skyline Suite at MGM Grand where we drank the rest of the evening away.
