In no particular order, I present to you: "5 online games that take you back to your childhood". So without further ado, let the nostalgia begin :) !

### 1. Neopets
The website where we all learned to gamble on Poogle races, buy and sell stocks, code guild, shop, and user lookup layouts in crude HTML & CSS, and lied about our ages because if we weren't 13+ we couldn't access the chat boards without our parents *faxing* a signed permission form to The Neopets Team!

### 2. Habbo Hotel
Lido Deck, furni races, sneaking out late at night to use the landline telephone to purchase coins for Habbo Club membership, need I say any more?

### 3. Maplestory
Easily the game which I've spent the most time on in my life, I still play to this day. The server has changed and grown dramatically since the original release in 2005, but it's still just as addictive as ever with its grindy level up mechanics.

### 4. The Sims
The Sims and The Sims 2 were a staple part of our childhood, and if you tell me you didn't remove the ladder from the pool while your sim was swimming to watch them drown, *you're lying*.

### 5. Runescape
So much time spent chopping wood and killing cows in Lumbridge.
