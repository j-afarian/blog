<h1>This is a blog; well, that's the plan,<br>
it'll probably just be a bunch of photos of my pets.</h1>
<p>I'm Jenna Afarian, commonly known as Bella. I like to tinker with tech, travel, explore, eat, and go to the gym. I got married in Las Vegas, Nevada. Originally from Sydney, we now live in Brisbane with our cockatiel and chihuahua babies. I'm obsessed with video games and books.</p>
