<h1>This is a blog, well - that's the plan,<br>
it'll probably just be a bunch of photos of my dog.</h1>
<p>I'm Jenna Afarian, commonly known as Bella. I like to tinker with tech, travel, explore, eat, and go to the gym. I got married to a pretty cool guy in Vegas, we live in Brisbane with our cockatiel and chihuahua babies. I'm obsessed with video games and books.</p>
